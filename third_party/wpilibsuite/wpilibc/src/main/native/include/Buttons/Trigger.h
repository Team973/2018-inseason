 * This class provides an easy way to link commands to inputs.
 *
 * It is very easy to link a polled input to a command. For instance, you could
 * link the trigger button of a joystick to a "score" command or an encoder
 * reaching a particular value.
 *
 * It is encouraged that teams write a subclass of Trigger if they want to have
 * something unusual (for instance, if they want to react to the user holding
 * a button while the robot is reading a certain sensor input). For this, they
 * only have to write the {@link Trigger#Get()} method to get the full
 * functionality of the Trigger class.
